## Tips for AI Image Generation

1. **Style Consistency**: Always include style descriptors like "cinematic style," "ultra-detailed," and "professional photography" to maintain a consistent look.

2. **Lighting Specification**: Be explicit about lighting to create mood (e.g., "warm lighting," "dim office lighting," "dramatic backlighting").

3. **Contextual Details**: Include environmental elements that reinforce character traits (e.g., Wei's code-filled whiteboard, Kevin's designer coffee).

4. **Emotion and Expression**: Specify the emotional state or expression for character portraits (e.g., "confident smile," "intense focused eyes").

5. **Technical Quality**: Request "high definition," "ultra-detailed," and "professional quality" to get the best results.

6. **Iterative Refinement**: After generating initial images, refine your prompts based on results. Add more specific details for areas that need improvement.

7. **Post-Processing**: Plan to do some post-processing in photo editing software for consistency across multiple generations.
